{% include "voice-bot/bot_include.html" %}
```

    def attached_function(request, **kwargs):
        ...
        return render(request, 'your_template_name.html', {"commands": kwargs['commands'],
                                                           "bot_name": kwargs['bot_name']}
```
7. Start the development server and visit ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/```
   to create a voice-bot (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

5. Setup your bot
In the admin panel, you need to set the bot's language, name, and messages about successful and unsuccessful command execution.<br>
The```speech_full``` flag will play all trigger phrases for all bot commands when activated.<br>
Then you need to set commands for the bot.<br> Parameters:<br> ```description``` — description of the bot;<br> ```redirect_url``` — URL that will be redirected to when executing the command, can be global.<br> ```trigger_words``` - the words that trigger the command must be separated by commas.<br> ```message``` — the message that will be voiced when the command is executed.<br> ```api_url``` - link to the url from which data will be uploaded.<br> ```api_flag``` — when activated, the default message will be replaced with the one received from the API.<br> ```api_header``` - the header from which the new message will be written.<br> ```request_headers``` - request headers.
